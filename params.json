{"name":"Poison.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"### 欢迎来到毒药的个人博客空间\r\n我是毒药，专注与WEB安全测试，现就职于cisco合肥研发中心，从事cisco webex online meeting安全方面的开发与测试工作。\r\n\r\n### 个人教育背景\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### 个人成就\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### 个人理想 \r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### 联系方式\r\nWeChat Account: Poisoner1024\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
